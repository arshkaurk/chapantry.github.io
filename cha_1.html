                                                        tea, if we didn’t already know from years of visits. And when the first pot
                                                        was inevitably drained, we’d make another and the whole process would
                                                        start again. During Ramadan, an uncle with henna in his hair would
                                                        throw tea leaves in a tin pot with milk and sugar during tarawih
                                                        prayers. He’d strain it into individual cups and serve it with 
                                                        desserts to the exhausted believers after a long day of fasting.

                                                        Nowadays, I take my friends out to grab cheap chai at my favorite 
                                                        Pakistani restaurants and sometimes, we make a facsimile of uncle-
                                                        chai on our stove top when friends visit. I imagine for other children 
                                                        of immigrants like  me, a similar story plays out. For me, tea drinking 
                                                        is, by its nature, social. There is no tea without other people.
